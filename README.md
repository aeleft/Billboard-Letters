# Billboard-Letters

Hello, 

This is a simple program that, given the previous message on a billboard and a desired future message on the billboard, outputs the extra letters one will need (along with the number of copies of each letter) to change the previous message to the future message.
It also outputs letters and the number of copies of each letter that will need to be removed from the billboard to change the previous message to the future message.
